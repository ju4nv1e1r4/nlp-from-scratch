Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

New AI agent evolves algorithms for math and practical applications in computing by combining the creativity
of large language models with automated evaluators
Large language models (LLMs) are remarkably versatile.
They can summarize documents, generate code or even brainstorm new ideas. 
And now we’ve expanded these capabilities to target fundamental and highly complex problems in mathematics and modern computing.

Today, we’re announcing AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models for general-purpose algorithm 
discovery and optimization. AlphaEvolve pairs the creative problem-solving capabilities of our Gemini models with automated evaluators 
that verify answers, and uses an evolutionary framework to improve upon the most promising ideas.

AlphaEvolve enhanced the efficiency of Google's data centers, chip design and AI training processes — including training the 
large language models underlying AlphaEvolve itself. It has also helped design faster matrix multiplication algorithms and find new 
solutions to open mathematical problems, showing incredible promise for application across many areas.
